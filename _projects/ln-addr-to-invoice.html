<p>
    <span itemprop="description">Some popular Bitcoin Lightning wallets, like Muun
        or Blue Wallet, don't support email-like Lightning addresses. This app allows
        paying to such addresses by turning them to convenient invoices.</span>
    For me, it is helpful when zapping and tipping in Nostr.</p>

<p>To use the app, click on the Lightning address link (like tip or zap in
    Nostr) and select "LN Address to Invoice" app. Follow the instructions and then
    pay the invoice with your favorite wallet.</p>
<p>The app doesn't add any extra fee to your payment.</p>

    If you find this app useful and want to support the project, you can

    On-chain Bitcoin and Lightning are accepted, of course.
    I am very grateful to everyone supporting my work
