from unsupported wallets"

<p>
    <span itemprop="description">Some popular Bitcoin Lightning wallets, like Muun
        or Blue Wallet, don't support email-like Lightning addresses. This app allows
        paying to such addresses by turning them to convenient invoices.</span>
    For me, it is helpful when zapping and tipping in Nostr.

<p>This utility is launched when you interact with addresses in your browser or other apps. Here's
    how it is done:</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <h4>Clicking an address</h4>
        <p>Sometimes, a Lightning address is a clickable link, just like an email. When you click
            it,
            LN Address to Invoice appears.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <br>
        <center>
            <img alt="Clicking an address"
                src="{% link /assets/img/projects/{{ page.slug }}/clicking.gif %}" width="200">
        </center>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <h4>Selecting an address</h4>
        <p>Often a Lightning address is just a text. In this case, select it and in the appeared
            system
            menu look for the <b>Send sats</b> action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <br>
        <center>
            <img alt="Selecting an address"
                src="{% link /assets/img/projects/{{ page.slug }}/selection.gif %}" width="200">
        </center>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <h4>Copy-pasting an address</h4>
        <p>You can always just copy an address and paste into LN Address to Invoice
            with the Paste button in the header of the intro screen, or with the
            <b>Paste address</b> launcher icon shortcut.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <br>
        <center>
            <img alt="Launcher icon shortcut"
                src="{% link /assets/img/projects/{{ page.slug }}/shortcut.gif %}" width="200">
        </center>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The app doesn't add any extra fee to your payment.</p>
