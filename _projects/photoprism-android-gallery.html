    The official progressive web application of the
    <a href="https://www.photoprism.app/" target="_blank">PhotoPrism library</a>,
        despite being mobile-friendly, can't be integrated into the phone OS and, no
        matter what,<a href="https://blog.perryizgr8.com/photos/2023/03/20/google-photos-alt.html#photoprism" target="_blank">
        feels like a webpage</a>. I actively use PhotoPrism, so I decided to make a
        native gallery and content provider for Android aiming to solve these issues.
        This app does not (and probably will not) support all the web-client features,
        but nevertheless it can:<ul>
        <li>Provide the library content to other Android apps – you can select
            PhotoPrism Gallery among other galleries when picking a photo or video</li>
        <li>Open the library content in suitable apps – you can use your favorite image
            editor or video player instead of web viewer</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<img
    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="{{ page.title }}"
    src="{% link /assets/img/projects/{{ page.slug }}/screenshots.png %}">
<p>
    There are more handy features in the gallery:<ul>
        <li>Chronological grouping – the content is grouped by days</li>
        <li>Chronological fast scroll – slide the scroll bar to quickly jump to a
            specific month</li>
        <li>Search by media types and custom queries</li>
        <li>Search bookmarks – the search configuration can be bookmarked and applied
            later with a click</li>
        <li>Endless session – no need to re-enter password</li>
        <li>Connection to both private and public libraries</li>
        <li>Support of mTLS (mutual TLS) and HTTP basic authentication</li>
        <li>TV compatibility – easy browsing with a remote-control</li>
    </ul>
    The gallery is confirmed to work with PhotoPrism versions from June 7, 2023 down
    to October 9, 2021.</p>
