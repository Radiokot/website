    <span itemprop="description">A native Android gallery and content provider for
        your
        <a href="https://www.photoprism.app/" target="_blank">PhotoPrism library</a>.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    The official PhotoPrism PWA, despite being mobile-friendly, can't be integrated
    into the OS and has other drawbacks. This app does not (and probably will not)
    support all the web-client features, but nevertheless it can:<ul>
        <li>Provide the library content to other Android apps – you can select
            PhotoPrism Gallery among other galleries when picking a photo or video</li>
        <li>Open the library content in suitable apps – you can use your favorite image
            editor or video player instead of web viewer</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There are more handy features in the gallery:<ul>
        <li>Chronological grouping</li>
        <li>Search by media types and custom queries</li>
        <li>Endless session (you don't have to re-enter the password)</li>
        <li>Connection to both private and public libraries</li>
        <li>{% include emoji.html name = 'hourglass_not_done' actual = '⏳' %} Chronological fast scroll</li>
        <li>{% include emoji.html name = 'hourglass_not_done' actual = '⏳' %} Saved searches</li>
    </ul>
    The gallery is confirmed to work with PhotoPrism versions from November 18, 2022
    down to October 9, 2021.</p>
