    The official web application of the
    <a href="https://www.photoprism.app/" target="_blank"> PhotoPrism open-source photo library</a>,
    despite being mobileâ€‘friendly and well optimized, can't be integrated into the phone OS and, no
    matter what, feels like a site in a browser rather than a mobile app. Me and my wife started
    using PhotoPrism as a replacement for Google Photos, and we really missed the convenient mobile
    gallery experience for it. Hence, I decided to make an own native Android app to solve the
    problem.

    As I published
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photoprism/comments/120hvs9/android_gallery_and_content_provider_for/"
        target="_blank">the first version</a>,
    it turned out to be liked by many other PhotoPrism users, which inspired me to further improve
    the gallery.
