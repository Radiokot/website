<p>I truly enjoy riding my bicycle. Although I usually choose a well known
    route, sometimes the spirit of exploration makes me draw a route through the
    area I've never visited before. I can't remember all the turns in advance, so I
    have to rely on track navigation, for which I used OsmAnd. But this means I need
    to get directions somehow. I have no bike computer and I also didn't want to
    mount my phone on the handlebar ‚Äì the phone gets discharged very quick with the
    screen constantly turned on, and the setup looks unreliable. I neither wanted to
    ride with headphones nor turn on loud voice navigation ‚Äì I didn't want to lose a
    direction because of the wind, neither to draw extra attention. What I wanted
    was a visual navigation helper, power efficient and easily visible under the
    sun.</p>
<p>I've made a simple wireless display to help me. It shows the map data
    received from the Android app. The main components of the display are an Arduino
    board, a 1.54‚Ä≥ e-ink screen, a Li-Po battery and a BLE 5.0 serial module. The
    app subscribes to the GPS location updates and uses Mapbox SDK with my
    minimalistic black&white map style to compose frames.</p>

<p>Overall, the display capabilities are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Showing the current location on the map, which is rotated according to the
        bearing</li>
    <li>Showing a track on the map</li>
    <li>Importing tracks from .geojson files or from the
        <a href="https://brouter.de/brouter-web" target="_blank">BRouter web interface</a>
    </li>
    <li>Offline work, all the required map data is downloaded during the track import</li>
    <li>Showing step-by-step navigation directions from
        <a href="https://osmand.net/" target="_blank">OsmAnd</a>, which was the original purpose of the display, but turned out to be useless</li>
    <li>Long battery life thanks to Bluetooth Low Energy and Arduino frequency
        divider ‚Äì can be even longer though</li>
</ul>

<p>With this little thing I can explore new areas on my bike and don‚Äôt get lost
    or have to stop at every junction to check the route. This was my first portable
    wireless device, and although it is very simple and far less fancy than the
    market products, I consider this project a success and a great experience. It
    has brought me one of the feelings I really like ‚Äì when you‚Äôve successfully
    solved a practical life problem by making something yourself, whether it is an
    app, a device or even a useful spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I want to give my deep gratitude to my wife for believing in me and not
    letting me give up in moments of disappointment{% include emoji.html name = 'heart' actual = '‚ù§Ô∏è' %}</p>
