<p>In 2012 I first heard a song by Van der Graaf Generator. I was amazed by
    complex melodies, expressive manner of performance and amazing Hammill's voice.
    It was enough to realise this music is absolutely for me. Since then, VdGG and
    Peter Hammill became my true audio drugs and my cure from the sadness and
    troubles.</p>

<p>My interest has led me to the
    <a href="http://hammill.ru" target="_blank">hammill.ru</a>
    website, where I found a great collection of translations and explanations of
    Hammill's lyrics. Also there Mikayel Abazyan showed me a
    <a href="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/reports/others/Hammill.a4.ps.gz"
        target="_blank">digital book</a>
    with a content from two Peter Hammill's paper books and his songs, collected by
    pH7 web-group in the mid-1990s. But this book was in PostScript and it was
    awkward to read it on electronic readers such as Kindle.
    So I decided to recompile it using the FB2 format, which is more suitable
    for such devices.

    drawings from «Killers, Angels, Refugees» and «Mirrors, Dreams, and Miracles»,
    plus a lot of P.H. and VdGG songs. I've added some new albums and painted
    Hammill's portrait for a cover. Hope you find this book useful ;)</p>
