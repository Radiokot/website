# Oleg's website
This is [my website](https://radiokot.com.ua) built with Jekyll. It came to replace the [pure one](https://github.com/Radiokot/website-pure), all the styles and layouts are left intact.

## Notes for the future me
- Large files, like books, must be manually placed under the "files" directory on the server
- Install the [recommended VS Code extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_recommended-extensions)
